# AKONA CIKO: Unsupervised_Learning_Project

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

#### Key Findings: n/a

#### Dataset details:

The dataset contains user ratings for various anime titles, including metadata such as genre, release year, and studio. It consists of user-item interactions (ratings) and content-based information (anime attributes like genre, length, and more). The dataset may also include user demographic details for enhanced personalization. It is essential for training collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models.

#### Packages & Libraries:

Key libraries include:

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Surprise or Implicit for collaborative filtering.
TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models (if applicable).
LightFM for hybrid recommendation systems.
Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization and analysis.

1. Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop an advanced anime recommendation system utilizing both Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF) techniques. This system aims to predict user ratings for unseen anime titles, ensuring a personalized experience. The project will also address the end-to-end lifecycle, from data preparation to deployment and continuous monitoring for performance improvements.

2. Key Objectives
Recommendation System Development
Build a recommendation engine utilizing two popular techniques:

Collaborative Filtering (CF): Predict user preferences based on historical interactions between users and anime titles.
Content-Based Filtering (CBF): Recommend anime based on content similarity (genre, tags, plot, etc.) to previously rated or liked titles.
Prediction of Ratings
Accurately predict ratings for unseen anime titles by leveraging both CF and CBF techniques, enabling personalized recommendations.

Deployment in a Production Environment
Design and implement a model capable of deployment into a production environment, ensuring scalability, robustness, and integration with external applications.

Data Pre-processing
Implement necessary data cleaning, transformation, and preparation techniques to ensure the dataset is ready for model training and validation.

Post-Deployment Monitoring
Develop mechanisms to monitor the performance of the deployed system. Regular evaluation, updates, and maintenance to be performed to ensure the system meets the evolving needs of users.

3. System Requirements
3.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing
Data Sources:
Anime title metadata (genres, descriptions, etc.).
User interaction data (ratings, reviews, likes).
External databases such as MyAnimeList, AniDB, or similar.
Data Preprocessing:
Removal of duplicates and irrelevant data.
Handling missing values in the dataset.
Normalization/standardization of data for training (if needed).
Transformation of categorical variables into numerical representations.
3.2 Model Requirements
Collaborative Filtering:

User-item interaction matrix creation.
Matrix factorization (SVD, ALS) or nearest-neighbor-based methods.
Evaluation metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), Precision, Recall, etc.
Content-Based Filtering:

Feature extraction for anime content (tags, genres, descriptions).
Cosine similarity or TF-IDF for similarity calculation between anime items.
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, etc.
Hybrid System: Combine both CF and CBF for a hybrid recommendation engine, balancing strengths of both methods for improved performance.

3.3 Deployment Requirements
API Development: Design and implement an API for the recommendation system to serve predictions to end-users.
Scalability: Ensure the system can handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations with low latency.
Integration: Implement integration with a web or mobile application for real-time recommendation delivery.
Security: Secure user data and API endpoints with authentication protocols.
Cloud Infrastructure: Consider deploying on scalable platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability and ease of access.
3.4 Performance Monitoring
Model Evaluation: Regular evaluation of recommendation quality based on feedback and new data.
Performance Metrics:
Latency of recommendations.
Precision, recall, and diversity of recommendations.
Error Tracking: Set up error monitoring for failed recommendations, incorrect predictions, or system downtime.
Continuous Learning: Periodic re-training with updated data and improvement of recommendation strategies.
4. Functional Requirements
User Interface:

Simple and intuitive user interface for interacting with the recommendation system.
Ability to rate anime and receive recommendations.
Option for users to provide feedback on recommendations to improve the systemâ€™s accuracy over time.
Backend:

Efficient and scalable data storage solution for storing ratings and metadata.
Integration with the recommendation engine to provide real-time suggestions.
API:

RESTful API for accessing recommendations.
Authentication system for user management.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: The system should be able to handle an increasing number of users and anime titles without significant performance degradation.
Reliability: Ensure high availability of the recommendation system.
Security: Implement security best practices to protect user data and system integrity.
Maintainability: The system should be easy to maintain, update, and improve.
Extensibility: The system should be easily extensible for adding more recommendation techniques or features (e.g., incorporating hybrid models, new data sources).
6. Evaluation Metrics
Collaborative Filtering Model Evaluation:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Precision and Recall at K
Content-Based Model Evaluation:

Cosine Similarity metrics.
Classification accuracy metrics for item recommendations.
Hybrid Model Evaluation:

Combining CF and CBF evaluations for overall model performance.
Deployment Metrics:

Average Response Time for Recommendations.
System uptime.
API request success rate.
7. Deliverables
Recommendation System Model: Fully trained and validated CF and CBF models.
API: RESTful API that serves recommendations to users.
Documentation: Clear and concise documentation for both the recommendation system and API, including user guides.
Monitoring System: Tools and processes for ongoing performance evaluation and model retraining.

The dataset used in this analysis was collected from an authorized source (??????_FILL), special thanks to them !

Challenges & Highlights_
Challenge: Managing the large dataset size required optimizing code for efficiency and memory usage. To add on that it was SUPPER fun working this kind of a Project, really convinced that it is the most I enjoyed- guess this is because it's easy to see & understand "WHY & WHAT"_?? you doing --Much closer to HOME Project, otherwise all Project were quite FUN to do!!
